    "Another family of measures worth mentioning are based on adjacency matrices, where rows and columns represent vertices, and cells represent egdes.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If you consider each row to be analagous to a feature vector in machine learning applications, you can see how the network structure can be used to, for example, cluster similar nodes together by deriving distance measurements such as cosine similarity, correlation coefficient, or Euclidean distance, from rows the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important additional network metric based on this is __Assortativity__, that is, the extent to which nodes that have similar attributes are connected.  This can be expressed as a ratio between the number of connections within a group, and the number of expected connections if the edges were randomly distributed between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social stratification, by, for example, age, can result in assortative mixing in a network.\n",
